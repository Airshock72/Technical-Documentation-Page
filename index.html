            <p>Welcome to Wowhead's Retribution Paladin guide, updated for Shadowlands Launch! This guide will teach you
                to master
                playing Retribution Paladin in all aspects of the game, helping you to deal optimal DPS in Mythic+
                dungeons.</p>

            <p>Throughout this guide, we will cover many different aspects to increase your Retribution Paladin
                expertise, including
                concepts like Retribution Paladin talents and strengths, Retribution Paladin
                stat priorities, among many other aspects of your class and specialization. Make sure to navigate to
                additional pages of
                the Retribution Paladin guide to find more in-depth information on topics such as Covenants, Mythic+ and
                PvP</p>

        <!--section for Best Races & Strengths-->
        <section class="main-section" id="races-strengths">
            <header>Best Races & Strengths</header>
            <p>Racials are incredibly close for Retribution. You shouldn't feel pressured to pick the race with the
                "best" output. The
                differences are small and can change depending on your gear or situation. However, if you want to pick
                your race purely
                based on their damage output, then the best Alliance races are Human, Dark Iron Dwarf, and Draenei, with
                the best one
                depending on your gear level. Lightforged Draenei is the best Alliance race in AoE situations. For
                Horde, all three
                races that can be Paladins will effectively contribute the same damage from their racial abilities. The
                Blood Elf racial bonus has multiple effects.
                The primary use for this ability is that it removes 1 beneficial effect from all enemies in range. This
                is great for
                removing abilities such as <a href="https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1022-blessing-of-protection"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_sealofprotection.jpg" /> Blessing of Protection</a>
                from Paladins or <a href="https://www.wowdb.com/spells/158478-soul-of-the-forest"><img
                        src="images/ability_druid_manatree.jpg" /> Soul of the Forest</a>
                from Restoration Druids. It can also be used versus players using the
                <a href="https://www.wowdb.com/items/168613-tempered-scale-of-the-scarlet-broodmother"><img
                        src="images/inv_summerfest_firespirit.jpg"> The Crucible of Flame</a>
                Major Essence to remove the stacks it creates. The other effect is that it restores resources based on
                what specialization you are.

            <p>Ret Paladins buff their allies with their Auras and Blessings, and can find value in their utility in
                both PvE and PvP
                situations. Provides strong burst damage in both single target and AoE situations. Retribution has many
                viable talent combinations making gameplay variable and customizable.
                Retribution's biggest weakness is its mobility. <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190784/divine-steed"><img
                        src="images/ability_paladin_divinesteed.jpg" /> Divine Steed</a>
                is decent, but outside of that there are very few mobilityoptions for Ret.</p>

            <h3>Shadowlands Changes for Retribution Paladin</h3>

                <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=465/devotion-aura"><img
                            src="images/spell_holy_devotionaura.jpg" /> Devotion Aura</a> - Grants a small damage
                    reduction. Probably the most valuable aura for a raid as a whole.</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32223/crusader-aura"><img
                            src="images/spell_holy_crusaderaura.jpg" /> Crusader Aura</a> - Increases mounted speed.
                    Notably also increases the speed of <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190784/divine-steed"><img

                            src="images/spell_holy_crusade.jpg" /> Retribution Aura</a> - Rather than being a raid-wide
                    buff like the other auras, the Paladin using the aura gains <a

                            src="images/spell_holy_mindsooth.jpg" /> Concentration Aura</a> - Reduces the duration of

        <!--section for macros-->
        <section class="main-section" id="macros">
            <header>Macros</header>
            <p>Macros are simple, in-game tools which allow you to sequence spells together, create custom names and
                icons, cast
                different abilities depending on whether the target is friendly or hostile, define targeting conditions,
                and much, much
                more. While the amount of options can be complex, making them is easy, so in this section we'll go over
                how to set them
                up yourself.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To open the in-game Macro interface, type "/macro" or "/m".</li>
                <li>Choose between the General and Character-specific macro tabs. Then click the "New" button on the
                    macro window.</li>
                <li>Choose a Name and an Icon so you can easily recognize your macro, then click "Okay."</li>
                <li>Select your new macro and use the text editor below to tell it what to do. If copying ours below,
                    you can simply
                    copy/paste the text in.</li>
                <li>Click the "Save" button, and drag your macro icon onto your bars, which will allow it to be used
                    just like any other
                    spell from your spellbook.</li>
                <li>To close the window, click "Exit", or just press Escape.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For more information on creating macros, including full lists of conditionals, modifiers, and other
                command
                customizations you can use, check out our full <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/making-a-macro-commands-modifiers-warcraft-guide">Macros guide.</a>
            </p>
            <p>Macros can often help make your life a bit easier when playing in a variety of situations. Here's some
                examples of how
                they can be used with Retribution abilities.</p>
            <p>You can use conditional macros to keep <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=152262/seraphim"><img
                        src="images/ability_paladin_seraphim.jpg" />Seraphim</a> and <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=105809/holy-avenger"><img
                        src="images/ability_paladin_holyavenger.jpg" /> Holy Avenger</a> on the same key bind without
                having to replace the spell whenever you swap talents.</p>

            <p>Use Holy Avenger or Seraphim when talented:</p>

            <pre>#showtooltip<br />/cast [talent:5/2] Holy Avenger<br />/cast [talent:5/3] Seraphim</pre>

            <p>If you need to interrupt one target while focusing damage on another, you can set it as your focus target
                and use this
                macro to interrupt it without having to manually swap targets to do so.</p>
            <p>Casts Rebuke on your focus, or on your target if you have no focus target:</p>

            <pre>#showtooltip<br />/cast [@focus,harm,nodead] [] Rebuke</pre>

            <p>Using [@&ltplayer name here>], [@targetoftarget] and similar modifiers can help you use your utility more
                easily if
                they're always going to be used on a specific player or role. Target of target macros can be useful for
                assisting
                your tanks.</p>

            <p>Places Blessing of Freedom on a set raid member:</p>

            <pre>/cast [@NAMEOFPLAYER] Blessing of Freedom</pre>

            <p>Uses Lay on Hands on your target's target:</p>

            <pre>/cast [@targettarget] Lay on Hands</pre>

            <p>Instead of having to target the location of <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=343721/final-reckoning"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_blessedresillience.jpg" />
                    Final Reckoning</a> every time you cast it, you can have it automatically cast either on your
                character or at your cursor.</p>

            <p>Casts Final Reckoning on top of your character:</p>

            <pre>#showtooltip<br />/cast [@player] Final Reckoning</pre>

            <p>Casts Final Reckoning at your mouse cursor:</p>

            <pre>#showtooltip<br />/cast [@cursor] Final Reckoning</pre>

            <p>The same macros will work for other targeted effects like <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=316958/ashen-hallow"><img
                        src="images/ability_revendreth_paladin.jpg" /> Ashen Hallow</a> , just swap out the spell names.

            <p>Mythic+ is a special type of dungeon mode in Shadowlands, offering players an endlessly-scaling
                challenge. High-end PvE
                players will want to clear a Mythic 14 dungeon every week to receive the best possible loot from the <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/great-vault-weekly-chest-objectives-rewards-shadowlands">Great
                    Vault</a>,
                awarding ilvl 226 gear and some Anima. Individual runs reward the group with one piece of loot, based on
                the difficulty
                ran, up to item level 210.</p>

            <h3>How to find Groups as a Retribution Paladin</h3>
            <p>Retribution isn’t usually one of the top “meta” specializations, so you may find it slightly more
                difficult to find
                groups than some other melee specs due to its community perception. However, you can absolutely perform
                well in Mythic+
                as Retribution at a high level if you put the time and effort into it.</p>

            <p>One of the best ways to prove your value to your group is through active use of your utility tools. If
                you’re trying to
                dispel abilities that the healer can’t, stunning and interrupting casts whenever you can, and using your
                many blessings
                and healing abilities to help keep the group alive, then people are likely to notice and want to play
                with you again.
                Other than that, be aware of enemy’s threat levels and give the tank a few seconds at the start of a
                pull before you use <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_avenginewrath.jpg" /> Avenging
                    Wrath</a>, or be ready to <a href="https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1022-blessing-of-protection"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_sealofprotection.jpg" />
                    Blessing of Protection</a> yourself to drop threat otherwise. A dead Paladin doesn’t do any damage,
                and tanks will be less likely to want to run
                dungeons with you if you frequently die due to pulling threat.</p>

            <header>PvP</header>
            <p>Shadowlands Retribution Paladin is a more complete and wholesome version of Retribution than what we've
                had for the past
                few expansions. We can build this specialization to be a top contender in Battleground team fights,
                1v1's, World PvP,
                and Arena.</p>

            <p>It's a great expansion to be a Ret Pally! They are easy to pickup and play as always but also feature an
                enormous skill
                ceiling with certain builds.</p>

            <p>Your role in Arena as Retribution will be to deal burst damage and making the most of your <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=853/hammer-of-justice"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_sealofmight.jpg" /> Hammer of Justice</a> by coordinating with your team
                to help land more CC or set up a swap, and to counter-play your opponents with your
                utility and off-healing.</p>

            <p>Retribution is viable all the way up to Rank 1 ratings right now and has a place in the meta as long as
                it's a fast
                meta. The class requires a high amount of awareness to succeed at the highest end but it is very easy to
                start out with
                and to deal damage.</p>

                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=465/devotion-aura"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_devotionaura.jpg" /> Devotion
                    Aura</a> as your aura. If somebody else already has it covered, either <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=32223/crusader-aura"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_crusaderaura.jpg" /> Crusader
                    Aura</a> can help your <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190784/divine-steed"><img
                        src="images/ability_paladin_divinesteed.jpg" /> Divine
                    Steed</a> speed, or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=183435/retribution-aura"><img
                        src="images/spell_holy_crusade.jpg" /> Retribution
                    Aura</a> can provide a damage increase if an ally dies.</p>

            <h3>How do I do more Damage?</h3>
            <p>There's a lot of things that could potentially affect your damage when playing Retribution. The <a
                    href="https://www.wowhead.com/retribution-paladin-rotation-guide">Rotation Guide</a> will
                cover the optimal way to play, but here's some common mistakes you could be making:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Wasting Holy Power by using abilities that generate it while you already have 5 Holy Power.</li>
                <li>Not using your Holy Power builders on cooldown, losing potential Holy Power over an encounter.</li>
                <li>Similarly, prioritizing spending Holy Power instead of generating it. You should almost always focus
                    on the optimal way
                    to generate Holy Power and spend during downtime between their cooldowns.</li>
                <li>Holding cooldowns like <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=31884/avenging-wrath"><img
                            src="images/spell_holy_avenginewrath.jpg" /> Avenging
                        Wrath</a> or <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=255937/wake-of-ashes"><img
                            src="images/inv_sword_2h_artifactashbringerfire_d_03.jpg" /> Wake of Ashes</a> for too long,
                    losing potential casts.</li>
                <li>Poor positioning or wasting <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/spell=190784/divine-steed"><img
                            src="images/ability_paladin_divinesteed.jpg" /> Divine
                        Steed</a>, resulting in low uptime on the boss.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Why isn't this Stat good? or, Why don't we use Stat Weights?</h3>
            <p>Retribution has a very complicated relationship with secondary stats. Although common wisdom is often
                espoused that
                "Haste is the best", "You should stack Mastery", in reality there's almost never a situation where you
                want to stack
                only one stat. This is reinforced with the new diminishing returns for secondary stats in Shadowlands,
                where the more
                rating you get of one stat the less value each additional point provides. In the end you're going to
                want a healthy mix
                of secondaries, which may end up biased slightly towards one stat over another, but will never end up
                only being
                something like "Haste/Crit".</p>

            <h3>What Covenant do I Pick?</h3>
            <p>The <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guides/retribution-paladin-best-covenant-shadowlands">Covenant
                    Guide</a> covers all of the pros and cons for each Covenant. However, if you're really unsure about
                what the
                best option to pick is, just choose one you enjoy playing with. None of them do much more damage than
                the other options,
                and at the end of the day you'll enjoy the game more playing with a Covenant that you like over another
                one that's a
                small damage increase.</p>
